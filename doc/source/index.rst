EMD: Empirical Mode Decomposition
=================================

EMD is a python package implementing the Empirical Mode Decomposition and
functionality for ananlysis of instantaneous frequency.

THIS PAGE IS UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPEMENT! - PLEASE WATCH THIS SPACE FOR MORE EXAMPLES AND TUTORIALS

Features
========

  * A range of sift algorithms including: sift, ensemble sift, complete ensemble sift, mask sift
  * Instantaneous phase, frequency and amplitude computation
  * Cycle detection and analysis
  * Hilbert-Huang spectrum estimation (1d frequency spectrum or 2d time-frequency spectrum)
  * Second layer sift to quantify structure in amplitude modulations
  * Holospectrum estimation (3d instantaneous frequency x amplitude modulation frequency x time spectrum)
